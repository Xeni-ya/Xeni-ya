<p align="center">After graduating from university, I realized that I would not work in my specialty, but I want to do what I like, what makes my eyes burn and when you see the result of your work! Then I clearly understood for myself in which direction I want to develop. 
I am currently studying to be a frontend developer. 
I am slowly but surely moving towards my dream</p>
